## Methods: 

Data Collection: The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provided metagenomic sequencing data, which focused on samples taken in the spring and summer of 2024 from the Chase Lake Wetlands.

Analytical Techniques: QIIME 2 was used for the microbial community analysis and R for the statistical analysis. The bioinformatic studies were centered on diversity indices and tests of connection between the microbial presence and environmental parameters.
