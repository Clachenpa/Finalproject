### **Discussion**

Interpretation of Results: The variety of Alpha-Proteobacteria and their relationship to nitrogen levels indicate that these microorganisms are important for the nitrogen cycle in the wetland, which may have an impact on the health of the ecosystem as a whole.

Implications for Wetland Management: Knowledge of these connections can direct conservation initiatives and aid in the prediction of the effects of fertilizer loading on microbial populations.

Study limitations : The study's limitations stem from the way it relies on data from a single season, which might leave out seasonal fluctuations in microbial activity.
