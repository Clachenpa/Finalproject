### **Motivating Reasons**

### One motivation for this research stems from an increasing scientific interest in understanding how microbial communities influence and are influenced by different ecosystems and environmental factors. We will be focusing our study on Alphaproteobacteria and the Chase Lake Wetlands. Wetlands serve crucial ecological functions, including water filtration and carbon storage, and microbes are at the heart of these processes. These microbial communities, like Alphaproteobacteria, are sensitive to environmental changes and are able to provide early warning signs of ecosystem stress or degradation. Another one of our motivating reasons is the environmental impact. Studying these microorganisms.
